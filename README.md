A final wish
<br>
I think of myself as a shadow , with no one to notice me. I have helped an awful lot of people but I was always replacable.
<br>
All these imaginary thoughts of becoming someone impactful never came to light because I never acted according.
<br>
Oh the wish to be on the spotlight, the person who is noticed by everyone once he enters the room .
<br>
But the truth is bitter, I am acknowledged by none.
<br>
This country deserves a better genre of mentors , one who cares for their students.And I will become an exception. I will become the teacher I wanted as a student.
<br>
I will have my spotlight for a short time.This was all I ever wanted, to be wanted by someone.
<br>
In the end , I will leave will nothing and no one by my side. The question which will always haunt my mind is could I not be helped not to hurt anymore?
<hr>
It breaks my heart to see what i have become and how I have lived my life. Like a blurred moon , it will fade away very soon.
